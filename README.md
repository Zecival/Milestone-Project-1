# War Card Game

War Card Game is a two player game in which the deck is shuffled randomly, and then split into two halves face down, and then the player and the computer both flip a card up from the top of the deck. The higher ranking card wins, taking the loser’s card and returning both cards to the bottom of the winner’s deck. This process is done until one player loses all of their cards. 

For the ranking of cards, the highest value will win; this is the order of the cards from lowest to highest: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A. In the case that two cards of the same value are flipped, it results in a draw, and borh cards are returned to the bottom each player’s deck.
